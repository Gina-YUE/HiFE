# HiFE
This repository contains the code of the HiFE model, which aims to solve the highly compressed deepfake content.

The file "HiFE.py" is the model code of the paper "DeepFake Detection Based on High-Frequency Enhancement Network for Highly
Compressed Content", Please cite us if you are interested in it. 

The Backbone Xception's pretrained model is 'xception-43020ad28.pth'. When you use it, please change your path in the file 'xception.py'.
